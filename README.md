# CueSquared

CueSquared is a third party vendor and developer of a mobile patient payment system for the healthcare industry. As my management role and an EHR Product Manager for the Revenue Cycle at Beth Israel Lahey Health, I integrated MobilePay into Epic to allow patients to receive a shortcode text message to their cell phones to notify them of their billing statement. A link within that message allowed patients to make a payment towards their balance with just one touch. This integration has improved the patient collection rate drastically and provided a simple option for patients to pay their medical billing statements.
